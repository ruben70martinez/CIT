    <h2>Ruben Martinez</h2>
    <p>Hey y'all! My name is Ruben and I am from Eagle Pass, Texas. I have been up here at BYU-I for 2 years now and I love it. Some of my personal interests include sports, video games, and tv shows. I have a deep love for hawaiian food as well.</p>
    <p>I am a CIT major and this is my 2nd semester doing it. I was previously a communications major, but felt I needed a change. The reason I chose this major is because I eventually want to work for Amazon Web Services one day. I'm taking this course to use it for both my professional and personal life</p>
    <p>I currently work at walmart and take online classes to pay for rent and tuiton. I prefer it this way because it gives me a flexible schedule to do as I please. My goal for this semester is to get to know some of you and to work together to succeed in ths course.</p>
